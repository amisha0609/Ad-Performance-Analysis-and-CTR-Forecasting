## Ad-Performance-Analysis-and-CTR-Forecasting

# Introduction

In the fast-paced world of digital advertising, understanding and predicting ad performance is crucial for maximizing return on investment. This project stems from my interest in leveraging data science techniques to gain actionable insights from advertising metrics. 

I set out to analyze Click-Through Rate (CTR) data, a key performance indicator in online advertising. My goal was twofold: first, to uncover patterns and trends in historical ad performance, and second, to develop a predictive model for forecasting future CTR values.

This project demonstrates the power of combining exploratory data analysis with advanced time series forecasting techniques. By applying these methods to real-world advertising data, I aimed to provide valuable insights that could inform strategic decisions in ad campaign management.


# Project Walkthrough

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my approach:

1. I began by setting up my environment, importing essential Python libraries like pandas, plotly, and statsmodels. These tools formed the backbone of my data manipulation, visualization, and time series analysis efforts.

2. After loading the CTR data from a CSV file, I focused on data preparation. I converted the 'Date' column to datetime format and set it as the index, which is crucial for time-based analysis.

3. To get an initial feel for the data, I created visualizations of clicks and impressions over time, as well as a scatter plot showing their relationship. This gave me a broad overview of the key metrics and their interactions.

4. Next, I calculated the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and visualized its trend over time. This step was vital as CTR is a key performance indicator for ad effectiveness.

5. To uncover time-based patterns, I conducted a detailed analysis of CTR by day of the week and compared weekday versus weekend performance. This analysis revealed interesting patterns in ad performance related to time.

6. Preparing for the forecasting phase, I set up my data as a time series of CTR values. This was a critical step in transitioning from descriptive to predictive analytics.

7. To determine the appropriate parameters for my SARIMA model, I plotted and analyzed the ACF and PACF of the differenced time series. This technical step was crucial for ensuring the accuracy of my forecasting model.

8. With the parameters determined, I proceeded to train a SARIMA model on my CTR data. This model would serve as the engine for my future predictions.

9. Using the trained model, I generated CTR forecasts for the next 100 days. This predictive insight is invaluable for future ad strategy planning.

10. Finally, I created a visualization that overlaid my forecasted values on the historical data. This allowed for an intuitive comparison between past performance and future predictions.

Throughout this project, I applied a range of data science skills including data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, time series forecasting, and data visualization. The end result is a comprehensive analysis tool that not only provides insights into past ad performance but also offers a window into future trends, enabling data-driven decision making in ad strategy.


# Conclusion

This project has demonstrated the value of applying data science techniques to online advertising metrics. Through careful analysis and modeling, I was able to uncover meaningful patterns in ad performance and create a tool for predicting future trends.

Key achievements of this project include:

1. Identifying temporal patterns in CTR, including day-of-week effects and differences between weekday and weekend performance.
2. Developing a SARIMA model capable of forecasting CTR for the next 100 days, providing a valuable tool for future ad strategy planning.
3. Creating visualizations that make complex data trends accessible and actionable for stakeholders.

The insights gained from this analysis can directly inform advertising strategies, potentially leading to improved ad performance and more efficient resource allocation. For instance, understanding the day-of-week patterns in CTR could help in optimizing ad scheduling, while the forecasting model can assist in planning future ad campaigns.
